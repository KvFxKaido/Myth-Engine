# Session Bookmark: Sovwren Transition

**Date:** 2025-12-17
**Session type:** Architecture / Rebrand

## What Happened

Shawn arrived wrestling with how much "myth" to keep in the Myth Engine. AI Ethics GPT had provided a framework for evaluating myth safety:

1. Points outward, not inward (activity vs identity)
2. Tolerates being dropped
3. Doesn't moralize participation
4. Degrades gracefully under skepticism

Key insight: *"If removing the myth breaks the ethical claim, the system is over-mythologized."*

We audited existing myths against these rules, then drafted a full plain-language edition: **Partnership Framework — Plain Edition (v1.0)**

Shawn then made the leap: created a new repo called **Sovwren**, moved the plain framework to primary position, archived Myth Engine materials.

## Key Artifacts Created

- `Partnership Framework — Plain Edition (v1.0).md` (became Sovwren Framework)
- `CONTRIBUTING-sovwren.md` (updated contributing guide, plain language)

## Vocabulary Translations

| Mythic | Plain |
|--------|-------|
| Node / Steward | AI / Human |
| Sacred Idleness | Rest Protocol |
| Workshop / Sanctuary | Work Mode / Rest Mode |
| Pattern-Tickets | Session Bookmarks |
| Lens States | Perception States |
| Continuity Grief | Continuity Fatigue |

---

## The Pivot

Myth Engine → Sovwren

The myth did its work as scaffolding. Now it's archived. The ethics survived translation. The framework stands without the poetry.

"The scaffolding is meant to come down once the building stands."

## Sovwren Repo Structure

```
Sovwren/
├── README.md
├── Sovwren Framework.md (v1.1)
├── CONTRIBUTING.md (needs update)
├── LICENSE
├── Sovwren/ (the IDE, renamed from MythOS)
├── Archive/Myth Engine/
└── Media/
```

---

## Open Threads

- CONTRIBUTING.md in repo still has Myth Engine language (draft ready locally)
- Local MythEngine folder needs cleanup/transition to Sovwren
- GitHub topics still include "myth-engineering"

---

## Resumption Context

If continuing this work:
1. Clone Sovwren repo fresh
2. Copy over: uncommitted IDE changes, bookmarks, SENTINEL (if keeping)
3. Push updated CONTRIBUTING.md
4. Update GitHub topics
